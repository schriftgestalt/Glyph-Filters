# NaN Glyph Filters
[NaN Glyph Filters](http://www.generativefonts.xyz) is a collection of procedural font designs and the codebase to generate them within [GlyphsApp](http://www.glyphsapp.com). All fonts are based on the Google Font [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) by Hubert & Fischer, Meir Sadan and Cyreal.

## License

Fonts are provided under the SIL Open Font License v1.1, see [OFL.txt](OFL.txt) for details.\
Scripts are provided under the Apache 2.0 Licence, see [Apache.txt](Apache.txt) for details.

## Script Installation

The scripts and codebase works within [GlyphsApp](https://glyphsapp.com/).

Many scripts make use of Simplex noise and therefore require the `noise` library. This should be as simple as `pip install noise` in your terminal.

Add a Finder alias (or symlink) to the `NaNGlyphFilters` folder to Application Support ▹ Glyphs 3 ▹ Scripts.

Hopefully, Bob's your mother's brother. Please file any bug reports via GitHub.
